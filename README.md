# Climber

This is my first unity game. I spent a lot of time in classes and banging my head into my desk to get knowledge about unity and C#. I hope you like the game!

# Game Story

This is the climb of **Lil' Pill Bro**. He is trying to climb to the top. Can you get to the top without raging?(it's easy!). Maybe try to make it to the top without dying? There may be shortcuts along the way if you have zero deaths? There is also a prize if you make it to the **VERY TOP** without dying! If you forget how many times you died, don't worry! There is a death counter in the top right that is impossible to miss! Can you beat your highscore?

# About Game

This is a *Roguelike* game, meaning, when you die,  ***YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE START***. Even if you are one jump away from the finish, you go back to the start. No matter where you are.

## Player

You can move **Lil' Pill Bro** by using `WASD`. You can make him jump by pressing the spacebar, and you can move the camera by dragging your mouse across the screen. It's as simple as that.

## Enemys

They are AI and there are many types! There are your Short Range Shooter Guys! They are on platforms you jump on most of the time, and have short sight and attack range, but they get close and personal. And then there's your sniper guys. They are always behind a death wall on a platform. They have a long sight range and a long attack range. It's hard not to be spotted by them. But no matter then enemy, just don't get hit. (I made them specificly so thay have bad aim if you keep going). 

But the worst thing, is you can't kill them(if you get to the top with zero deaths, there is a chance that it may be different :)). They have invisible walls, everywhere.(If you know what unity is, there are no invisible walls, just the nav mesh). They can't walk off ANYTHING.
