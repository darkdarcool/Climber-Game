# Climber

This is my first unity game. I spent a lot of time in classes and banging my head into my desk to get knowledge about unity and C#. I hope you like the game!

# Game Story

This is the climb of **Lil' Pill bro**. He is trying to climb to the top. Can you get to the top without raging?(it's easy!). Maybe try to make it to the top without dying? There may be shortcuts along the way if you have zero deaths? There is also a prize if you make it to the **VERY TOP** without dying!
