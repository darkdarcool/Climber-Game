# Climber!

Climb To the top

Hi! And welcome to climber. You need to prove that you can climb to the top. People might get jealous and try to stop you, but you're better than them. You have to climb to the top. 
## Welcome to climber.

Made by @darkdarcool in Unity!

# Hiya! 

It's me, [darkdarcool](https://github.com/darkdarcool)! Y'know, the creator of the game? Sorry if you didn't like the intro, but I liked it so too bad. But now, I'm going to write this readme like a normal person, okay? 

# Contributing

There really isn't a way for you to contribute, as this is in unity and is a little hard to understand with all of the files that are usually hidden and such. But if you want to, leave ideas in issues and I will try my fastest(jk) to get to them! 

# Playing 

WASD and spacebar. That's all you need. It's pretty obvious what they do. Also, you might wanna dodge enemy bullets. Chances are, you're dead the second they hit you. No no no, it's not like the bullets kill you. No. That's dumb and irrational. There's reset barriers everywhere that will take you right back to the start. The bullets are big and strong. While you are strong, you can't beat them. They will knock you very far away. Sometimes in your favor(like up), and sometimes right into reset barriers. But, what are these enemy's you might ask, well I'll tell you about them!

## Enemy's

They are ruthless. They don't give up. They might get up close and personal, or they might stay back and snipe you.

Whatever they are... don't get hit.

Chances are, when you get hit, you're done. Dead. Beaten. Gone. But don't give up. Get up and try again. Learn why they hit you, shake it off, and go again. Don't let them win.

# Closing

Hope you have fun playing this. Make sure to start this!
